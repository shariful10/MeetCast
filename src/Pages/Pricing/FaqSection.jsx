                    Flowbite is first conceptualized and designed using the
                    Figma software so everything you see in the library has a
                    design equivalent in our Figma file.

                    The main difference is that the core components from
                    Flowbite are open source under the MIT license, whereas
                    Tailwind UI is a paid product. Another difference is that
                    Flowbite relies on smaller and standalone components,
                    whereas Tailwind UI offers sections of pages.

                    However, we actually recommend using both Flowbite, Flowbite
                    Pro, and even Tailwind UI as there is no technical reason
                    stopping you from using the best of two worlds.
